# Simple Calculator - QA Testing Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a simple arithmetic calculator implementation and a comprehensive set of test cases designed to ensure its reliability. The focus of this project is on **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)**, covering functional, boundary, and error-handling scenarios.

## Files in this Repository
* `calculator.py`: The source code for the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division logic.
* `Calculator_Test_Cases.md`: Detailed test documentation including Test IDs, descriptions, and expected results.

## Features Covered
- Basic Arithmetic (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
- Decimal Precision
- Division by Zero handling
- BODMAS/PEMDAS logic
- Input validation (Non-numeric character rejection)
